        <p id="abt">
          Even though, I don’t have many years of experience under my belt, I am
          very confident in being able to learn quickly, be flexible, and stay
          curious. Over the summer I have been able to learn the basics of SQL
          and the Command Line and hope to continue to improve and grow my
          knowledge base to more programming languages. I am also taking the
          opportunity to learn though Gateway Community College – HTML, CSS,
          Java, to name a few.

          I started off as a student in high school that was guided by them to
          succeed in college. Once I finished the program, I decided to come
          back and help seniors in college prepare for college.
